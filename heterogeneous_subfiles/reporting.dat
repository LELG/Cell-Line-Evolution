250: population size
no. clones
avg/eff proliferation rate / mutation rate


Events:
Pre/Post crash:
Lowest
Highest

Snapshot / tree - pre crash
-> All graphs -> lowest
-> All graphs @ pre-crash

Simple recovery metric

Time b/ween -> plat, crash, recovery, 1/2 size, etc

dump parameters to file
.dat file ->filter results
master file <- simple
master file <- all data

Fix problems with dead tumour trying to print

Fix effective proliferation


dump 'mid' data


AFTER minimum size (after crash) pick highest point
number of cells and clones


print init mut rate
why is mutation rate diff in printout? from start value


bifurcating tree
